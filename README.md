# Anti-Rootkit Project

This repository holds a tool which detects common beahaviors of rootkits and informs the user of any suspicous activity. 

The main focus of this tool is to detect different hooking techniques,  both in the kernel and in user-space. A rootkit tends to hook different data in the system in order to hide itself or its resources (processes, files, netowk traffic, etc). By detecting such hooks, we can identify whether or not there is a rootkit in the system.
